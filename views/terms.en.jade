                    li Rights and Obligations of Users
                        ol

                            li Users are aware that offering help on a voluntary basis is a voluntary activity which is not expected to be reimbursed with a fee or any other monetary benefits. The act of helping is not considered to be a form of employment within the context of an employment contract, nor is it a service or authorisation contract under the Law of Obligations Act.
                            li The precise and specific content, scope, extent (powers), deadline, means and place of providing help are agreed upon by Users for each instance of assistance separately.
                            li Helpers shall put the necessary effort into the assisting procedure in accordance with the nature of the assistance and personally provide help according to their knowledge and skills while keeping Aid Seekers’ best interests in mind.
                            li Helpers shall follow the instructions of Aid Seekers throughout the process of providing assistance. Helpers are required to notify Aid Seekers of all relevant circumstances, especially those that may prompt the Aid Seekers to alter their instructions or refuse the offer of assistance.
                            li Helpers may refuse to carry out actions that exceed the reasonable amount of assistance, are illegal, unethical or do not suit their abilities in terms of age, health or other respects.
                            li Helpers shall avoid situations that may endanger their own health or property, or those of Aid Seekers or third parties.
                            li In the event of force majeure, Helpers have the right to refuse to provide the assistance that has been agreed upon, but should notify Aid Seekers within a reasonable time. Force majeure is an external event or circumstance which could not have been influenced by the Helper or Aid Seeker; neither can they be expected to have taken the circumstances into account when agreeing to the helping procedure or to avoid it or overcome it or its effects.
